Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the application of engineering principles in the development, designing, testing and deployement of software.
  The importance of software engineering in the technological industry is to enhance scalability, security, collaboration, automation of processes and foster innovation in the modern      world

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference)
       The term "Software engineering" was first introduced in 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the software crisis
       The software crisis was due to missed deadlines by lack of a reliable software to handle such matters
  2. The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s)
       Structured programming introduced principles like sequence, selection, and iteration, reducing reliance on unstructured "spaghetti code."
  3. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s – 1990s)
       Here languages such as Smalltalk, C++, and later Java popularized OOP, leading to its widespread adoption in enterprise and consumer applications. 
      
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning
      In the planning phase, project scope, feasibility studies and objectives are defined to give insight at the task at hand
  2. Requirement Analysis
      Here user needs are identified and properly documented to be presented to stakeholders
  3. Design
      This stage entails the architecture designing of the softwares structure, components and setting of a clear UI.
  4. Implementation (Coding)
      This stage involves developers who transform the idea into code using programming languages and frameworks
  5. Testing
      The quality assurance team then chips in at this stage to test the softwares functionality among other things such as usability e.t.c
  6. Deployment
      Relaeasing the software to end users then follows and can be gradual or a full release/ deployment
  7. Maintenance & Support
      This is a continuous process that involves fixing bugs, software updates and security enhancements. 
      All this is done based on users feedback of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall methodology - Is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
  Agile Methodology: An iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes continuous collaboration, incremental development, and adaptability to changing requirements. Agile divides work into smaller cycles called sprints (typically 1-4 weeks long), allowing teams to deliver functional software in iterations.
<em>Comparison of Waterfall and Agile</em>
  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
