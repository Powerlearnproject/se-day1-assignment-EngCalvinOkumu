#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the application of engineering principles in the development, designing, testing and deployement of software.
  The importance of software engineering in the technological industry is to enhance scalability, security, collaboration, automation of processes and foster innovation in the modern      world

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference)
       The term "Software engineering" was first introduced in 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the software crisis
       The software crisis was due to missed deadlines by lack of a reliable software to handle such matters
  2. The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s)
       Structured programming introduced principles like sequence, selection, and iteration, reducing reliance on unstructured "spaghetti code."
  3. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s – 1990s)
       Here languages such as Smalltalk, C++, and later Java popularized OOP, leading to its widespread adoption in enterprise and consumer applications. 
      
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning
      In the planning phase, project scope, feasibility studies and objectives are defined to give insight at the task at hand
  2. Requirement Analysis
      Here user needs are identified and properly documented to be presented to stakeholders
  3. Design
      This stage entails the architecture designing of the softwares structure, components and setting of a clear UI.
  4. Implementation (Coding)
      This stage involves developers who transform the idea into code using programming languages and frameworks
  5. Testing
      The quality assurance team then chips in at this stage to test the softwares functionality among other things such as usability e.t.c
  6. Deployment
      Relaeasing the software to end users then follows and can be gradual or a full release/ deployment
  7. Maintenance & Support
      This is a continuous process that involves fixing bugs, software updates and security enhancements. 
      All this is done based on users feedback of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Waterfall methodology - Is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
  
  Agile Methodology: An iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes continuous collaboration, incremental development, and adaptability to changing requirements. Agile divides work into smaller cycles called sprints (typically 1-4 weeks long), allowing teams to deliver functional software in iterations.
  
Comparison of Waterfall and Agile
  Approach - waterfall methodology is sequantial while agile is iterative and incremental
  Flexibility - waterfall is rigid in its processes while agile is flexible
  Customer Involvement - Liitle customer involvement in waterfall methodology but continuous feedback from customer is crucial in agile methodology
  Project size - waterfall is best for large projects with fixed requirements while agile is suitable for dynamic projects that have changing requirements
  Risk management - Waterfall methodology faces a high risk if mistakes are detected later while agile faces low risk due to the iterations in the processes

  Examples of Use Cases
  
  Waterfall is mainly used in large projects like banking softwares, Governement systems etc
  
  Agile methodology is mainly used in startups, web and mobile applications

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models like ChatGPT. It involves structuring questions, providing    context, and using specific instructions to guide the AI in producing more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

        Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions
            Enhances AI Response Quality

                Well-crafted prompts lead to clearer, more informative, and contextually relevant responses.
                Example: Instead of asking "Explain machine learning," asking "Explain machine learning in simple terms with an example" produces a better answer.
            Reduces Misinterpretations

                AI models can be vague or off-topic if prompts are ambiguous.
                Providing specific instructions ensures precision.
                Example: Instead of "Tell me about Java," specify "Explain Java programming language features and use cases."
            Optimizes Efficiency

                Well-structured prompts reduce trial and error, saving time in AI interactions.
                Example: A developer can use structured prompts for code generation instead of manually debugging vague outputs.
            Improves AI-Assisted Creativity & Problem-Solving

                Helps generate creative content like stories, marketing copy, and design ideas.
                Example: "Write a futuristic sci-fi story set in 2100 about AI and humans coexisting."
            Essential for AI-Powered Automation

                In chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service AI, precise prompts improve user interactions.
                Example: In customer support, a well-designed prompt like "Summarize this complaint and suggest a resolution in 3 sentences" improves automation.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    "Tell me about testing."

          Why is it vague?

                Too broad: Doesn’t specify the type of testing (software testing, product testing, medical testing, etc.).
                Lacks focus: Doesn’t indicate whether the user wants a definition, types, or best practices.
                No context: AI may generate an overly general response that may not be useful.
    "Explain the different types of software testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software development."

          Why is this more effective?
                Clear Scope: Specifies "software testing" instead of the general term "testing."
                Specific Focus: Asks for types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance).
                Concise and Direct: The request is clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
                Purpose-Driven: Asks about the importance of testing, ensuring a meaningful response.
